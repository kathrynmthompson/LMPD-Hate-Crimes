# LMPD-Hate-Crimes

This project will look into data collected by Louisville Metro Police Department on various hate crimes around the city of Louisville. I will be analyzing the zip codes where the hate crimes are located within the city. The data used for this project was a subset of the incident data collected from the Louisville Open Data portal data.louisvilleky.gov. 

This data was pulled into Jupyter and cleaned up using a trim function. SQL will be used to create a demo staging table and completed in a staging table. Using a SQL database. The data will then be visualized as a bar graph of the hate crimes in difference zip codes.
